# Challenge: Frontend Travel Website

This challenge can be found on [CodingChallenge.dev](https://codingchallenge.dev/challenge/travel-website/)

## Getting started

Before we start coding we have to do a few things.

### Setup project

1. Make sure you have installed NodeJS on your computer.
2. Run `npm install` via the terminal in this directory. _If you get an error, that npm can't be found in your computer. You probably have not installed NodeJS._
3. When the depencies are installed, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. You can check http://localhost:1234 to check the website.
5. When you change the HTML, CSS or JavaScript files, the server will automatically refresh the browser üëç. I've used [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) to set it up for you üòâ

### Create a planning

1. I recommend that you make a planning for yourself.
2. If you prepare yourself carefully, changes are higher that you succeed.
3. Divide everything in tasks. So you can move them from todo, in-progress to done.
4. I've written a post about [how to give more structure to your development projects](https://byrayray.dev/5-steps-give-structure-to-your-development-projects/) which I highly recommend.

### structure

In this project you find a few files:

-   index.html
-   assets/
    -   js/
        -   index.js
    -   CSS/
        -   index.css
-   package.json
-   .gitignore
-   README.md
-   yarn.lock

## What to build

For this challenge you‚Äôre going to be building a travel website with HTML and CSS that looks like the above design.

You can find the design on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4156052-Trave-world-Landing-page/attachments/950182).

-   Build it to the best of your ability
-   No CSS or JavaScript Libraries or Frameworks, that might just make it too easy. That means no Bootstrap, Material, Foundation or jQuery.
-   Include a README.md with some details of how you completed this challenge. Awesome things to include:
    -   Challenges you faced and how you overcame them
    -   New skills you have learnt from the challenge
    -   What would you do differently next time?
-   Use the structure in the repo, if you‚Äôre feeling confident then feel free to mix it up a bit.
-   For extra bonus points why not make a blog post about a new skill you have learnt from this challenge.
